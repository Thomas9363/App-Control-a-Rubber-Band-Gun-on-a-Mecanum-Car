# App-Control-a-Rubber-Band-Gun-on-a-Mecanum-Car
The goal of this project is to design a system for remotely operating a rubber band gun mounted on a car equipped with mecanum wheels. This functionality is enabled through an Android application, which establishes a Bluetooth connection. As the car moves, the user can launch a rubber band by tapping a "fire" button on his smartphone.
